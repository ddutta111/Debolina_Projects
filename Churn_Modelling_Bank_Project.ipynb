        "An European bank has noticed a concerning increase in customer churn, with more customers leaving than expected. To get to the root of this issue, they conducted a study six months ago by selecting a random sample of 10,000 customers from their millions of clients across Europe. They collected detailed data on their demographic and financial characteristics, such as customer ID, credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, account balance, product holdings, credit card ownership, active membership status, and estimated salary.After monitoring these customers for six months, the bank identified who among them stayed and who left, indicated by a binary outcome in the dataset. They are now looking for expertise of a data analyst to help them analyze this dataset."

This model consists of only fully-connected layers, with no convolutional or specialized layers. The goal is to predict a binary outcome, which in this case is whether a customer will leave the bank (churn) or stay. ANN models are versatile and can be used for both regression and classification tasks. In this project, I will focus on ANN with classification.\n",

This could include personalized offers, improved customer service, or loyalty programs to encourage these customers to stay.\n",
